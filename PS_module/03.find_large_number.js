//Find max of two values
let firstNumber = 200 ;
let secondNumber = 300 ;
let largeNumber = Math.max(firstNumber, secondNumber);
console.log(largeNumber);

// Another way to solve this problem
let large_number = 0 ;
if(firstNumber < secondNumber){
    large_number = secondNumber ;
}else{
    large_number = firstNumber ;
}
console.log(large_number);


//Find max of three values

let Large_Number = Math.max(12,34,22);
console.log(Large_Number);


// or you can use if else 


// as a beginner that's the best way.
